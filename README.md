## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is **Minh Ngoc Le** (you can call me âœ¨ _Ngoc_ âœ¨).

I am an astrophysicist who is interested in:

- ðŸ”­ Globular cluster - dark matter halo relation
  
-  âœ¨ Low surface brightness galaxies

  âš¡ Fun fact: As a dog person, I enjoy petting dogs while getting stuck in my research.
